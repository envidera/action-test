## v0.1.4-pre-release

- typo: github auto-changelog action


## v0.1.3-pre-release

- changed: github auto-changelog action

This action checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your workflow can access it.

Only a single commit is fetched by default, for the ref/SHA that triggered the workflow. Set fetch-depth: 0 to fetch all history for all branches and tags. Refer here to learn which commit $GITHUB_SHA points to for different events.

The auth token is persisted in the local git config. This enables your scripts to run authenticated git commands. The token is removed during post-job cleanup. Set persist-credentials: false to opt-out.

When Git 2.18 or higher is not in your PATH, falls back to the REST API to download the files.
